I want to learn Java, so I make this thing.

Basically it's just Caesar cipher, but instead of limited to 26 characters, I expand it to include another unicode chars.

Ranged from \[space\] to ~.

Arguments:

-mod : either "enc" for encryption or "dec" for decryption.

-key: encryption key, integer value

-data: input data directly on command line.

-in: input file

-out: output file
